##Overview

This SmartApp will turn the indicator light on many Z-Wave light switches to a motion activated night light.  The indicator light will turn on when there is motion and the switch is off.  The indicator light will be off by default.

This SmartApp was forked from the Smart Nightlight SmartApp and modified to work with the indicator light.
